# CMI Issue Tracker

This is the official CMI issue tracker for the CMI plugin.

CMI is (currently) not open source. It's a premium plugin that you can get through [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/3742/). It requires the CMILib library file, which you can get [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/87610/).

Aside from issues you can also request features for CMI here.

If you are having any issues regarding payments and/or other private matters, please message `Zrips` on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/conversations/add?to=Zrips). (pre-sales [FAQ](https://www.zrips.net/faq/))
